# How to use

* Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (I used 2019 version) and build the program

## Note

* Task Scheduler is very unstable, the script doesn't usually start on "onidle". It's recommended to use "onlogon" or "minute" with modified time. (Such as every 30 minutes).

# Todo
* Make obfuscation function
